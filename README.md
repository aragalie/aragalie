<h1 align="center">Heya üëã Alex here, thanks for stopping by üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h1>
<h2 align="center">I'm passionate about building software at scale to improve people's lives</h2>

<h3 align="left">About me</h3>

Former tech Founder and CTO, I have an extensive track record of successfully leading engineering and product teams.

Proven experience in highly scalable Software Development and Systems Architecture. 

Focused primarily on backend and systems programming, preferably using Rust ü¶Ä

I tend to be language-agnostic, though I really prefer daily work in languages that are statically-typed, memory safe and with developed functional programming features. 

My belief is that great software engineering happens when the right tool for the job is used, with mindful application and focusing on the main thing that matters irrespective of anything else: that the software being created is adding significant value in a responsible way to its users.

<h3 align="left">Freelance/Contracting</h3>

Generally my focus is on helping your engineering team create more value for users with high throughput and low latency software development + systems architecture.

Extensive experience in developing scalable backend architectures on both GCP and AWS, using serverless infrastructure and IaC tooling such at SST (sst.dev), with persistent data storage on both NoSQL databases like DynamoDb or Firebase as well as SQL-based such as PostgreSQL. 

Backend-wise I've built codebases at scale with Node.js (Typescript) and Rust ü¶Ä 

On the frontend I have experience with React (Typescript) as well as Vue and pure HTML+CSS.

I very much prefer system architecture and backend development, but can handle the full stack if needed, including advanced DevOps such as CI/CD, cloud provider setup and configuration as well as complex networking.  

Fully remote only, I'm based in Zurich, Switzerland.
