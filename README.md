<h1 align="center">Heya 👋 Alex here, thanks for stopping by 🙋‍♂️</h1>

I'm passionate about building software at scale to improve people's lives.

Former tech Founder and CTO, I have an extensive track record of successfully leading engineering and product teams.

Proven experience in highly scalable Software Development and Systems Architecture. Focused primarily on backend and systems programming, preferably using Rust 🦀

Generally I tend to be language-agnostic, though I really prefer daily work in languages that are statically-typed, memory safe and with developed functional programming features. 

I believe that great software engineering happens when the right tool for the job is used, with mindful application and focusing on the main thing that matters irrespective of anything else: that the software being created is adding significant value in a responsible way to its users.
