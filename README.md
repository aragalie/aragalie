<h1 align="center">Heya üëã Alex here, thanks for stopping by üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h1>
<h2 align="center">I'm passionate about building software at scale to improve people's lives</h2>

<h3 align="left">About me</h3>

Former tech Founder and CTO, I have an extensive track record of successfully leading engineering and product teams.

Proven experience in highly scalable Software Development and Systems Architecture. 

Focused primarily on backend and systems programming, preferably using Rust ü¶Ä

I tend to be language-agnostic, though I really prefer daily work in languages that are statically-typed, memory safe and with developed functional programming features. 

My belief is that great software engineering happens when the right tool for the job is used, with mindful application and focusing on the main thing that matters irrespective of anything else: that the software being created is adding significant value in a responsible way to its users.

<h3 align="left">Freelance/Contracting</h3>

Generally my focus is on helping your engineering team create more value for users with high throughput and low latency software development + systems architecture.

Extensive experience in developing scalable backend architectures on both GCP and AWS, using serverless infrastructure and IaC tooling such as Terraform or SST (sst.dev), with persistent data storage on both NoSQL databases like DynamoDb or Firebase as well as SQL-based such as PostgreSQL. 

Backend-wise I've built codebases at scale with Node.js (Typescript) and Rust ü¶Ä in web2 as well as web3 (previous startup). 

On the frontend I have proven experience with React (Typescript) as well as Vue and pure HTML+CSS.

I've also done in the past Data Science and ML/AI using Python, JupyterNB, PyTorch and Tensorflow; used, configured and managed both on-premise GPU setups, as well as cloud-based infra and big data storage tooling like BigQuery. 

I very much prefer system architecture and backend development, but can handle the full stack if needed, including advanced DevOps such as CI/CD, cloud provider setup and configuration as well as complex networking. 

Based in Zurich üá®üá≠ and working fully remote only; I'm also open to collaborating only on a "per hour" basis, and not interested in full time or co-founder roles. Please take note of these aspects if you're reaching out with an opportunity.

You can get in touch with me via email [at this address](mailto:alex.ragalie@gmail.com).
